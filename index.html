        <p class="lead mb-4">Welcome and thank you for checking out my website. There is not much for me to really say here but I appreciate that you took your time to look through this site. I do not have much to show but I welcome you here to what I have to say.<br><br>

        My name is Amanda Sok and I am currently a student at the University of California Riverside. I chose to major in Business Administration as I am interested in going into the business field. Something I find rather interesting about business is finding out why companies would want to make certain decisions. It's possibly because of money and of course businesses would want to make decisions that would only raise their profits.  Perhaps after I finish college, I could go into a career in either accounting or finance. That way, I am helping out a company with their finances and finding out what are the best ways to maximize profit. As a person, I do not believe there is really anything unique for me to say about. I am a very disciplined person though. I do not wish to do anything that would only upset another. I am not one to socialize but I will try to talk if someone is talking to me first. It's not like I dislike people, I was never very good at talking to them.<br><br>

        There is not much to say about my work experience as I have never had any kind of job before but I have done some volunteer work before. I have done community service for the schools shown in the portfolio below. Sadly I do not have actual pictures of showing myself volunteering in these schools but they are the schools I helped out at. I am not one who leaves the house often so I do not have much experience on the outside world. I hope that after I am done with school, I can go into a career I love and be able to experience new things I have never done before. Like I've said before, there is not much to talk about when it comes having work experience. I suppose I should try to find the time to perhaps find a part time job to get experience on work. I did help out on my family's garage sale before. We did not get to sell everything but can be a lesson learned on how to price our "products" better. I also tried to help out at a shop one of my family members is working at. I got to see a bit of the insides of what it's like to work in a business. And really for the community services, it did help give me some sort of an idea of what it could be like to work at an actual job.
